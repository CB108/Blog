ANALYTICAL COOKING - Part I

Cooking and data-analytics are very different, this is true - opposites in fact; they could be used as examples to represent the left and right brain. But many things are true at the same time and in this case there is another accurate statement - cooking and data analytics are two sides of the same coin. 

It is the outward manifestation of these two actions that are so very different - the tools, the components, the skills, the arena in which they are performed in ... all completely different. But when I look passed that and experience the thought process underneath, its shockingly similar. 

It’s the ability to take a ton of information, hone in on what’s important and manipulate it in a way that makes it possible to understand. In the case of food, the chef needs to understand the palate. THAT is her audience...that is the stakeholder she needs to present to. So she takes her ingredients and washes them and realizes how fresh the tomatoes are and decides to make a sauce that highlights their natural flavor. She teases out the information in those tomatoes by introducing them to heat and salt. She uses garlic and onion to support the natural sweetness. The smells, and the sounds of the pan...it’s a stream of information, so much information. 

Similarly, when I look at a data-set, I am learning how to hone in on what’s important. How to hone in on what will best enable me to tell a meaningful story. One variable helps to bring out another. This is like using something sweet to help showcase something sour. Of course Excel and Python are very different from say...sautéing and blanching, but in the end, both data-analysts and chefs everywhere are doing there best to tell a story. They are working hard to pull everything they can out of their respective ingredients. It’s a beautiful process.
