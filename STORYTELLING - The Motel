Like a lot of haunted motels it was at the very edge of town.  This place was over eighty years old, and at the foot of a mountain so the wind blew through the property like a train. It howled, and it trimmed the trees. At night, the owner would come to the front desk in a long nightgown if you rang. He was a large man.

Each room had its own unique decor and they all seemed to be more disturbing than the last. I stayed in several. Some were flat out terrifying. I had two guests come visit me at two separate times, both left suddenly because they said the place gave them the chills. 

There was at least one framed picture hanging in each room and they always managed to be just a little bit off. On several occasions I took them down. The blankets would often be red or burgundy and the old desk lamps were crooked. The placement of furniture had an unsettling effect, the pieces were never arranged like they are everywhere else. The night stand would be halfway in the hallway or the bed would be against the wrong wall; things just didn’t make sense and I always moved something around to try and give it an adjustment. 

I wanted to like the place because I had to be there for the time being. I managed to clean a room up and whatever was in there when I arrived...it slowly dissolved and I could relax for the most part - eventually I could feel my world when I’d walk through the door. In one of the other rooms, the empty space seemed warm and agitated, like it was watching.
